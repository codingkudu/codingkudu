### Hi there. I'm a Kudu that codes ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I do a bit of Angular, Typscript, Groovy/Java, Frontend stuff work at work. I'm playing around with Python out of hours. Using this account for personal projects and fun. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: It's impossible to tell how many kudu live on a plot of land. They can easily jump fences.
